            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I first got introduced to data visualization about 2 years ago, when I discovered Tableau. After that, I went to as many free talks and workshops as I could, and also took a few dataviz courses through Udemy. I've been working as a freelance data visualization designer for about a year, mostly using Tableau. When I'm not doing data viz, I enjoy reading, playing music, and doing yoga.

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p> As a Math major in college I was a numbers nerd, but upon graduation I really had no idea what I wanted to do with my degree. After working for a year in the AI team of an investment company I realized my passion for data science and specifically visualization. Now I do contract work for a new market research company, which has really worked out well for me.</p>

            <h3>Hopes</h3>
            <p>Although I mostly use Tableau for work, I would really like to expand my toolset and be able to use d3.js (among other software) for interactive visualizations. I also hope to advance my design skills since I only have a basic eye for it. In the past, I've used online tools like rawgraphs.io and then customized them with Illustrator for static visualizations, and I'm excited to take that process even further.</p>
